# Forecasting directional movements of stock-prices for intraday trading using LSTM and random-forest
We employ both random forests on the one hand and LSTM networks (more precisely CuDNNLSTM) on the other hand as training methodology to analyze their effectiveness in forecasting out-of-sample directional movements of constituent stocks of the S&amp;P 500 from January 1993 till December 2018.
